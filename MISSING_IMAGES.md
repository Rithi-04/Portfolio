# Missing Image Files

The following image files need to be added to the `images/` directory to complete the skills section updates:

## Required Images:

### 1. C# Logo
- **Filename**: `csharp.png`
- **Purpose**: Backend skills section
- **Suggested source**: Microsoft's official C# logo or icons8.com
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: Approximately 60x60 pixels (will be auto-sized by CSS)

### 2. Postman Logo
- **Filename**: `postman.png`
- **Purpose**: Software and Tools section
- **Suggested source**: Postman's official website or icons8.com
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: Approximately 60x60 pixels (will be auto-sized by CSS)

## Download Instructions:

1. **For C# Logo**:
   - Visit: https://icons8.com/icon/55251/c-sharp-logo
   - Or: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35825
   - Download as PNG format
   - Save as `csharp.png` in the `images/` folder

2. **For Postman Logo**:
   - Visit: https://icons8.com/icon/EPbEfEa7o8CB/postman-api
   - Or: https://www.postman.com/company/brand-kit/
   - Download as PNG format
   - Save as `postman.png` in the `images/` folder

## What's Been Updated:

✅ **Removed**: React from Frontend skills
✅ **Added**: C# to Backend skills (image path: `images\csharp.png`)
✅ **Added**: Postman to Software and Tools (image path: `images\postman.png`)

## Alternative Solution:

If you prefer not to download images, you can:
1. Use text-only skill indicators
2. Use FontAwesome icons
3. Use CSS-only icons
4. Use placeholder images temporarily

The website will still function properly; the missing images will just show broken image placeholders until the actual logo files are added.
